## IMPORTANT RULES

- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Always use Bun instead of npm or pnpm for package management and script execution.
- Load `/but` skill only when task is git-related (commits, branches, PRs, history ops, status/push/pull/rebase/squash/amend/undo, etc.). Use `but` CLI for those tasks.
- Always use `but` CLI instead of raw `git` for: status, commit, push, amend, squash, undo, reword, branch ops, and PRs.
- Native `git` only for: cherry-pick, stash, tag, revert, blame, pull, log, diff, show.
